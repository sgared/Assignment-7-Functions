 What is the purpose of these programs?

The first inquiry is to create a function that takes two arguments, either numbers or dice, the number of sides, and the target number. Then, it calculates the probability of the target number. The second question pertains to a function that performs permutations with strings.

b. What does this program take as input?

The first one takes strings and integers, while the second one takes strings.

c. What is the expected output of the program?

The first one outputs numbers, including floating-point numbers. The second one outputs permutation series.

d. What types of execution are included in your program?

All six programs include input, output, conditional statements, sequencing, repetition, and reuse.

e. How could your program be improved?

The program performs many tasks manually, so there is room for improvement to operate more efficiently and to make it more robust.
